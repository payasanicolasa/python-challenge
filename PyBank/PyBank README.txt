**PyBank: Financial Analysis**

*Project Description:*
This is a Python script that analyzes a business's financial records to calculate each of the following values:

>The total number of months included in the dataset
>The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
>The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
>The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
>The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

**Analysis**
Over 86 months, the business's total profit amounted to $22,564,198.  August 2016 saw the greatest month over month net profit, earning %1,862,002; February 2014 saw the greatest decline (-$1,825,558).

*Challenges*
Because this is my first attempt at writing Python code, I came across several challenges, including (but not limited to) generating the net calculations for each month and returning the average, max, and min net values.

*To Use*
Run the script in Python.
