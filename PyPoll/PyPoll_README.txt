**PyPoll: Vote Counting Analysis**

*Project Description:*
This is a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

> The total number of votes cast
> A complete list of candidates who received votes
> The percentage of votes each candidate won
> The total number of votes each candidate won
> The winner of the election based on popular vote

**Analysis**
Out of 369,711 votes, Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes, or 73.8% of the total votes; this makes her the winner of the election.  Charles Caseper Stockham (23.04%) and Raymon Anthony Doane (3.13%) trailed.

*Challenges*
Because this is my first attempt at writing Python code, I came across several challenges, including (but not limited to) organizing my loops to prevent infinite printing of results and generating the list of candidates with their respective vote counts/percentages.

*To Use*
Run the script in Python.
